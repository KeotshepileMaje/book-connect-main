# Book Connect JavaScript Debugging

Welcome to the JavaScript debugging report for my final capstone project, Book Connect.

## Project Overview

Book Connect is a social media platform designed specifically for book enthusiasts. The initial version of this project featured impressive HTML and CSS work, but I encountered issues with the JavaScript code, which contained errors preventing the application from running smoothly. My primary task was to identify, address, and fix these critical issues.

## Goals

The main goal of this project was to debug the JavaScript codebase comprehensively. I worked to ensure that all critical issues were resolved, optimizing the code for the best user experience. My findings and debugging process are presented here for your reference.

## GitHub Repository

You can find the project's codebase on GitHub: [Book Connect GitHub Repository](https://github.com/YourUsername/book-connect)

Please feel free to explore the code and the debugging work I've done.

## Debugging Process

- **Issue Identification:** I thoroughly reviewed the existing code to identify errors and inconsistencies.
- **Debugging and Testing:** I systematically addressed and fixed each issue, ensuring the application's functionality was restored.
- **Code Optimization:** In addition to fixing errors, I also focused on improving code performance, readability, and future maintainability.

## User Stories

Although the main focus of this project was debugging, the following user stories guided my debugging process:

1. **View Book Previews:** Users can view a list of book previews by title and author to discover new books.

2. **Book Images:** Users can recognize books by their covers with associated images.

3. **Read Book Summaries:** Users can read book summaries to make informed reading choices.

4. **Publication Dates:** Users can see the publication date of books to assess their availability.

5. **Text-Based Search:** Users can find books based on specific text phrases.

6. **Filter by Author:** Users can filter books by author to discover more by their favorite writers.

7. **Filter by Genre:** Users can filter books by genre to find books in their preferred categories.

8. **Dark and Light Modes:** Users have the option to toggle between dark and light modes for comfortable nighttime usage.

## Conclusion

This project was primarily a debugging activity, and I'm pleased to present the results of my work. By identifying and addressing issues in the JavaScript codebase, I have contributed to the successful functionality of the Book Connect project.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository. I hope you find the debugging process and improvements I've made valuable and informative.
